/**
 * The BCMediaPlayback protocol specifies methods for initiating and monitoring 
 * the progress of media (video) playback.  Its features are inspired by Appleâ€™s
 * MPMediaPlayback protocol and the AVPlayer class: the interfaces should be 
 * familiar to developers who have worked with the Media Player and AV 
 * Foundation frameworks before while offering additional features and a 
 * higher-level of abstraction.
 * 
 * The BCMediaPlayback protocol supports basic playback operations including 
 * play, pause, and seeking to a particular point in the timeline.  It also 
 * provides observation points for receiving updates about the status of 
 * playback.
